                    Sweden&#39;s King Gustavus Vasa founded Helsinki on the mouth of Vantaanjoki River in 1550 to compete with Tallinn for Baltic Sea trade, but the town grew slowly and only flourished when construction of the Suomenlinna Maritime Fortress began in 1748, bringing in more residents and with them, more trade and wealth.

                    Today, Helsinki is one of the fastest growing cities in Europe with an intriguing mix of history and high-tech. When it hosted the Summer Olympics in 1952, Helsinki earned its reputation as an efficient and friendly city, and it still does today. In 2017, it set a record with 4.5 million tourists. It is also renowned for its efforts to protect and improve the natural environment and resources, as well as maintain economic and socio-cultural development in a balanced manner, attracting ecotourism, environmental events and conferences. This remarkable achievement has earned Helsinki the title of the first European Capital of Smart Tourism.

                    Helsinki has long been concerned with sustainability and is committed to bringing people together through authentic experiences, fun spaces and nature exploration. Helsinki plans to be carbon neutral by 2035, knowing that this will require the combined efforts of residents, cities, businesses and different organizations. Its public-private approach has resulted in new solutions and new businesses, enabling the city to achieve success and significant progress in this area. In 2017, Helsinki's emissions were 24% lower than in 1990, despite an increase of 150,000 inhabitants. It is also one of three major cities in the EU-funded mySMARTLife project, which develops smart solutions to reduce urban energy use by 10-20% and increase the use of renewable energy.

                <p>
                    The Helsinki region has 70 platforms to manage change in a controlled environment. Some are digital, such as the Helsinki Regional Infoshare database, while others are physical, such as the J&#x00E4;tk&#x00E4;saari Mobility Lab, stormwater quality management and domestic district heating demand response systems developed in the mySMARTLife project in Karasatama. Karasatama is a showcase for Helsinki's smart city solutions where smart city development is people-centred, with nearly one-third of Karasatama's residents participating in the co-creation of solutions, including a smart waste collection system, extensive electric vehicle capabilities, flexible shared spaces, and on-site renewable energy production.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, Helsinki is a leader in intelligent transportation, with a goal of reducing transportation emissions by 69% by 2035 compared to 2005 levels. Many emission reduction measures have been implemented or are planned. City buses have been electrified in 2021, and the subway and charging network have been expanded. Smart Grid in Karasatama is producing innovative demand response solutions, including V2G (vehicle-to-grid) electric vehicle charging stations that not only charge electric vehicles, but also allow unused electricity in cars to be brought into the smart grid. V2G also known as Vehicle-to-Grid Integration (VGI), can help the energy grid supply power during peak hours. On the other hand, more than half of Helsinki's carbon emissions come from the heating system. Helen Oy, the city's energy company, is working to reduce district heating emissions by 74% by 2035 by using waste heat and switching from fossil fuel production to renewable electricity production and the use of electricity storage facilities. Their goal is to stop using coal by 2030s.

                    Such a nice city, would you be tempted to visit and see for yourself if Helsinki is not only "the most functional and sustainable city in the world", but also an eco-friendly and beautiful city?
