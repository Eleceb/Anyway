                <h2>To catch up with the World Ocean Day, choose sustainable seafood</h2>
                <h5>Sat, Jan 1, 2022, 0:00 AM</h5>
                <div><img src="./assets/images/page1.jpg" width="40%" height="40%"></div>
                <p>
                    Hong Kong is currently the second largest per capita seafood consumption place in Asia. Each Hong
                    Kong people eat about 72 kilograms of seafood each year, which is an astonishing 3.6 times higher
                    than the global average of 20 kilograms. According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture
                    Organization, about 90 percent of the world&#39;s fish stocks are fully fished or overfished. As June 8 is
                    the World Ocean Day, Hong Kong people must turn to sustainable seafood, as our choices have a
                    direct and far-reaching impact on the world&#39;s fishery resources.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sustainable seafood is fishing in a way to maintain a healthy population of fish in the ocean, meaning
                    there will be enough seafood for future generations, marine life and its habitats to survive, and
                    those who depend on fishing to continue to make their livings. We need to act now or we may be
                    the last generation to get food from the ocean. While governments and seafood companies
                    ultimately must do their part to protect the oceans, as consumers, we need to demand traceability
                    in our seafood supply chains.
                </p>
                <p>
                    World Wildlife Fund encouraged consumers and suppliers to make responsible choices and take
                    action to conserve marine resources. Last year, they urged the seafood industry to list the source of
                    seafood on product packaging and provide complete product labels to help consumers make
                    choices. They have also launched a new &quot;Seafood Selection Guide&quot; (<a href="http://wwf.hk/seafood-guide">wwf.hk/seafood-guide</a>), which
                    includes a variety of seafood that Hong Kong people commonly eat, promotes the selection of
                    environmentally friendly and sustainable species caught or farmed. They divide seafood into &quot;Green
                    - Recommended,&quot; Yellow - Think clearly, or &quot;Red - Avoid.&quot; For example, we should avoid eating reef
                    fish such as grouper, which are common in the live reef fish trade in Hong Kong. In fact, they take 5
                    to 10 years to reach sexual maturity, transitioning from female to male as they mature. However,
                    they are usually caught before breeding, thus making their sex ratios unbalanced and causing
                    reproduction more difficult.

                    Another fish threatened by fisheries is the shark. Sharks are important predators of the ocean, and
                    they regulate the abundance of other animals in the food chain. This not only maintains the balance
                    of the ecosystem, but also helps to enhance the diversity of species. Despite their important role in
                    marine ecosystems, sharks are typically hunted for the commercial value of their fins and other body
                    parts, such as cartilage, but their numbers are rapidly reduced due to their slow growth and low rate
                    of fertility. Therefore, we should completely avoid food made from sharks. According to the Census
                    and Statistics Department, the import volume of shark fins in Hong Kong continued to decline, from
                    2,792 tons in 2019 to 1,655 tons in 2020, a decrease of 40% year-on-year. Although the number of
                    imports has dropped significantly, everyone should avoid eating these endangered fish and do their
                    part to protect the ocean.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As consumers, we can protect the marine ecology by reducing or even avoiding the consumption of
                    some endangered fish and aquatic products. If there is no demand in the market, the supply will
                    naturally drop and the species will be protected. In fact, it is only by supporting sustainable seafood
                    that healthy marine ecosystems can continue and our next generation can enjoy delicious seafood
                    dishes. Whether we eat less or choose more sustainable seafood, our oceans and our future
                    generations will thank us.
