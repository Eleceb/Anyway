                <h2>The waste goes to the recycling center and then what?</h2>
                <h5>Tue, Jan 4, 2022, 0:00 AM</h5>
                <div><img src="./assets/images/page4.jpg" width="60%" height="auto"></div>
                <p>
                    The world is facing the problem of not being able to properly sort the waste for recycling. Fortunately, artificial intelligence (AI) robots can help us this time. There is a resource recycling center in US, which uses AI robots to distinguish different recycle materials and make correct classifications. Their speed is twice as fast as that of workers in the same process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Recycling and sorting robots are dedicated to improving recycling infrastructure. The introduction of AI and robotics can improve the challenges faced by the resource recycling industry. First, it is difficult for consumers to distinguish which materials can be recycled and which cannot. Second, resource recycling takes time and manpower for the recycling center to distinguish different materials collected. If the recycling center only relies on manpower, it may not be a sustainable business because the cost is too high and the benefit is too small. However, with the assistance of a recycling robot, it is different. It can sort 80 different recycling waste in a minute, whether it is milk cartons, soda cans or glass bottles. It can distinguish the waste faster and more accurate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This will be an innovative and transformative technology for the recycling industry, because tens of thousands of different items have been recorded to the system. According to the big data to distinguish different types of wastes, AI has also begun to learn to identify the brand, shape and texture of the object, such as a certain trademark may be associated with plastic number 1; a particular shape may represent a certain box of corn chips, and so on. Such an automated system is really good news for the development of the recycling industry.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To date, most recycling facilities use equipment from the mining industry to identify items by density or shape. Of course, AI robots still have certain limitations. It seems that a bundle of recycling materials may contain plastic bottles or iron and aluminum cans, which need to be manually selected by humans. But it's good to have the assistance of a robot, because most recycling companies are facing shortage of staff and the work environment is full of unpleasant smells. However, robots are fit for recycling industry as they are not afraid of unpleasant odors and can save a lot of manpower. In the recycling plant, only a few workers are needed to work with robots together and help remove recycled materials that robots cannot yet pick. It is believed that recycling technology will continue to develop, and will be fully mechanized in the near future, contributing to the regeneration of the earth's resources.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the other hand, through more accurate recycling technology, recycling centers can collect more high-priced recycling materials in exchange for reasonable profits. For example, coffee cups made of high-priced paper materials could not be accurately recycled before because it was too difficult to pick out. Now, engineers have found ways to teach robots to find coffee cups, and the number has reached an industrial scale. At the same time, these recycling plants can obtain new data with a software update, allowing them to be more efficiently find recycled items from waste that would otherwise be buried in landfills. The same technology can also be used to sort waste electronics and construction waste.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although only a few recycling centers have used robots to assist in sorting materials, they are convinced that this is a general trend in the recycling industry. There is a hope that more resources can help the development of these technologies to improve recycling efficiency, so that the earth's resources can be continuously regenerated and long-term reduction can be achieved.
