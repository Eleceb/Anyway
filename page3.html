                <h2>Blind Massage + Coffee Shop</h2>

                    Unemployment is high during the epidemic, and it is even more difficult for people with disabilities to find employment. An organization concerned about blindness has opened the first social enterprise cafe in Hong Kong that combines coffee and massage services to provide employment opportunities for the visually impaired. Visually impaired baristas with less than 20% of their eyesight have trained and practiced brewing coffee by touch, feel and hearing the sounds.

                    In addition to more than a dozen visually impaired baristas taking turns to work in the coffee shop, there are also supervisors and cafe managers taking turns to supervise. The manager previously worked in a chain cafe group, and found that the visually impaired baristas are not much different from ordinary employees except that they need a longer time to familiarize themselves with the process. The manager will observe and give timely guidance before serving finished products to customers. The manager highly praised the visually impaired employees for their enthusiasm, and willingness to learn and do.

                    Increasing job opportunities for the visually impaired is one of the reasons why the Blind Massage Cafe was established. According to the research report of the Hong Kong Blind Union in 2018, the unemployment rate of the visually impaired is 19%, while the unemployment rate of the general population is 3%, which shows that the unemployment rate of the visually impaired is very high. In the past two years or so, the epidemic has raged and the economy has been sluggish. It has become more difficult for the visually impaired to find employment. Spas closed for business several times, the visually impaired masseurs lost their jobs. The Blind Association launched the "Enjoy Tomorrow" massage voucher program. Customers first purchase massage vouchers, and then exchange the service after the epidemic situation eases. Half of the prepaid amount will be given to the visually impaired masseuses, addressing their financial needs. The massage voucher program received a warmer than expected response and received support from many members of the community. On the other hand, the organization found that many baristas who graduated from the visually impaired coffee training class could not find jobs in other coffee shops. Therefore, they applied for funding through the government's "Entrepreneurial Development" program to open a coffee shop that also provides blind massage services, providing guests with a space for leisure and slow living. They also hope to combine massage and coffee shop together to increase the business opportunities for visually impaired massage therapists.

                    There are different steps for brewing fresh milk coffee, pressing powder, install the brewing container, extracting coffee liquid, pouring milk, beating milk, and fixing the latte art. It must be more difficult to imagine that these processes can only be completed by sound and feel. The visually impaired are just starting to learn, holding a brewing container full of coffee powder, afraid of dropping the coffee powder. After pressing the powder, install the brewing container to extract the coffee liquid, and then look for the button on the coffee machine. When it comes to processing the milk, how to judge the amount of milk poured and the time for warming the milk? They all rely on the touch to feel the weight of 12oz and the proper temperature of 60 to 70&#x00B0;C. When it comes to latte art, the barista counts silently in his heart, rhythmically making 6 to 7 circles. They say you can pull a decent heart pattern with a bit of luck.

                    The Blind Massage Cafe aims to give everyone a moment of leisure and provide employment opportunities for visually impaired people to be self-reliant. At the same time, it can also eliminate the doubts about the visually impaired from all walks of life. We all hope that through a good cup of coffee, a professional massage service, and an experience that everyone can enjoy, the public can understand and recognize the different abilities of the visually impaired, and change the perception towards them.
