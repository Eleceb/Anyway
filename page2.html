                    Potato milk is a new alternative to oat milk, almond milk and coconut milk, and soon you'll be able to find it on the shelves of Hong Kong supermarkets or online.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You may wrinkle your nose at the thought of potato milk, but think about it, we like to eat potato in different forms (eg: french fries, potato chips, etc.). Therefore, you can also try drinking potato milk? Actually, the idea of potato milk is nothing new. In Hong Kong, we drink bubble tea made with taro milk. Taro is a root vegetable widely used in Asian cooking, and we cook the taro like a potato (the texture is very similar when cooked) before making it into a drink.

                    Potato milk is a product that is good for the earth. First, it benefits the ecology of the planet. In general, plant-based milks are more sustainable than dairy products. However, if you compare potato milk with other popular plant-based milks, you may be surprised how eco-friendly it is. Potatoes are one of the most leisurely crops. They don't need much care to thrive. Once the seeds are sown, just let them grow on their own. Because of this, they tend to be more sustainable than almond, oat, soy, and other plant-based milk. In fact, potato milk has a 75% lower climate footprint than cow's milk. Additionally, it requires 56 times less water to grow than almonds. For the same yield, it takes half the land to grow oats, so it uses fewer resources than oat milk and less water than nut milk. This helps save water and avoid over-cultivation of land, allowing cultivation and production even in dry places. Therefore, if potato milk can be promoted, it is believed that the production of potato milk can help the residents of barren areas to develop their agriculture and industries, so that their lives can be improved, and doing so will not have too much impact on the environment. It really does kill two birds with one stone.

                    Environmentally friendly products are certainly welcome, but the sustainability of the business depends on the quality and nutritional value of the products. Potato milk provides protein and fibres. Besides, each 8oz (200ml) serving of potato milk contains about 3 grams of different nutrients such as calcium and vitamins B2, B12, D and folic acid. Dug, the company behind the world's first potato milk, has completely swept Europe. It is sure that its products will sweep the world in the near future. It currently offers three flavors of potato milk: original, coffee and sugar-free, and consumers say they love the plant-based milk.
